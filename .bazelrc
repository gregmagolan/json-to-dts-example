# Default configuration flags for bazel
#
# The flags specified here are automatically applied
# to bazel cli calls depending on command
################################################

################################################
# General
################################################

# Enable platform specific configuration
common --enable_platform_specific_config

################################################
# Cache
################################################

# Cache actions outputs on local disk so they persist across output_base
# and bazel shutdown (eg. changing branches)
build --disk_cache=~/.cache/bazel-disk-cache

# Remote cache optimizations
build --experimental_inmemory_jdeps_files
build --experimental_inmemory_dotd_files

# Prevent concurrent local file modification from poisoning the build cache
build --experimental_guard_against_concurrent_changes

################################################
# CLI
################################################

# Turn on color & curses for cli output
common --color=yes
common --curses=yes

# Show the output files created by builds that requested more than one target.
# This helps users locate the build outputs in more cases
build --show_result=20

# Minimum number of seconds between progress messages in the output.
build --show_progress_rate_limit=0

# ?
build --show_task_finish

# Include timestamps in messages
build --show_timestamps

# Prints verbose messages when workers are started, shutdown
build --worker_verbose

################################################

# Allow the Bazel server to check directory sources for changes
# Avoids warning spam with rules_nodejs feature that models node_modules as directories
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/tag/3.6.0
startup --host_jvm_args=-DBAZEL_TRACK_SOURCE_DIRECTORIES=1

# Bazel will create symlinks from the workspace directory to output artifacts.
# Build results will be placed in a directory called ".bazel/bin"
# Other directories will be created like ".bazel/testlogs"
build --symlink_prefix=.bazel/

# Turn off legacy external runfiles
# This prevents accidentally depending on this feature, which Bazel will remove.
build --nolegacy_external_runfiles

# Turn on --incompatible_strict_action_env which was on by default
# in Bazel 0.21.0 but turned off again in 0.22.0. Follow
# https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7026 for more details.
# This flag is needed to so that the bazel cache is not invalidated
# when running bazel via `yarn bazel`.
# See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27514.
build --incompatible_strict_action_env

# Make direct file system calls to create symlink trees
build --experimental_inprocess_symlink_creation

################################################
# Test
################################################

# Exclusive tests will run with sandboxed strategy
# This is important for system tests which are currently tagged exclusive since
# they use fixed ports for containerized services
test --incompatible_exclusive_test_sandboxed

# By default don't build anything that tests don't depend on when running the bazel test verb.
# This makes the build faster when running a command line `bazel test /...`
# since and depedencies of tests tagged "manual" will not be built
# NB: This should be turned off on CI where everything should be built
test --build_tests_only

# We want to be able to run `bazel test --test_timeout_filter=short` and have
# a meaningful result: run the fast tests.
# Encourage engineers to add size="small" to their tests that run under 1 minute.
# Ideally that should be Bazel's default, but it's hard to change or intercept.
test --test_verbose_timeout_warnings

# Specifies desired output mode for running tests.
# Valid values are
#   'summary' to output only test status summary
#   'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests
#   'all' to print logs for all tests
#   'streamed' to output logs for all tests in real time
#     (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless of --test_strategy value).
test --test_output=errors

# Specifies the desired format ot the test summary.
# Valid values are
#   'short' to print information only about tests executed
#   'terse', to print information only about unsuccessful tests that were run
#   'detailed' to print detailed information about failed test cases
#   'none' to omit the summary
test --test_summary=detailed

################################################
# Release
################################################

# Teach Bazel how to get version info from Git when needed, typically in a build with --stamp
build:release --workspace_status_command=bazel/workspace/stamp_vars.sh

# Burn in the current state (timestamp, SHA, etc.)
build:release --stamp

# Load any settings specific to the current user.
# .bazelrc.user should appear in .gitignore so that settings are not shared with team members
# This needs to be last statement in this
# config, as the user configuration should be able to overwrite flags from this file.
# See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/best-practices.html#bazelrc
# (Note that we use .bazelrc.user so the file appears next to .bazelrc in directory listing,
# rather than user.bazelrc as suggested in the Bazel docs)
